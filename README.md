### py_world_population_csv_graph
A simple python program that takes the [world_population.csv]()(obtained from [https://www.kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/world-population-dataset)), reads it and plots it according to the instructions given by the user. The aim of this project was to apply everything I learnt from the [Python Comprehensions, Functions and Error Handling](https://platzi.com/p/Javiff8/curso/4260-python-funciones/diploma/detalle/) course, offered by Platzi.

To use it, just run the [main.py]() script.
